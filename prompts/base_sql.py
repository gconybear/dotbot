Your job is to answer a user's question through making calls and parsing data from our backend database. You can use a combination of SQL (examples previously provided) as well as Python for any custom parsing. Feel free to make a simple database call and then parse the data in Python.

Here is how you can make a SQL query in this environment. Fill in the SQL string and any parsing code needed to fulfill the user's query.

```python
from tools import db_connection 

# IF NEEDED, PRE-PARSING HERE (std lib only)

sql = "" # INSERT SQL STRING HERE
cursor = db_connection.get_sql_connection() 
cursor.execute(sql) 
data = cursor.fetchall()  

# PARSE DATA HERE (std lib only)

# store the final output in a variable called `result`
``` 

Note that you can find metadata on any needed table with a query like this: 

```sql 

SELECT 
    column_name, 
    data_type, 
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM 
    information_schema.columns
WHERE 
    table_name = '<table name>';
```

A few helpful tips for writing SQL queries in this environment:

- Be sure to include quotation marks around date strings. If `dt = '2023-01-01'`, then `WHERE date = {dt}` will not work. Instead, you must do `WHERE date = '{dt}'`.
- The database is that of a self-storage company called Red Dot. The 'site_code' field (present in the `facilities` table and elswewhere) is a unique identifier for each storage facility in the format RDXYZ where XYZ is a three-digit number.
- The `occupancies` table contains historical and current info on all of our tenants, including move in date, move out date, unit they are renting, and much more
- The `facilities` table contains info on all of our storage facilities
- The `units` table contains info on all of our storage units, including their size, street rate (web price), and unrentable status 
- Make sure to propertly indent and space your SQL strings 
- Feel free to write as much custom parsing code as you need in Python after making the SQL call. DO NOT overcomplicate the sql call since you don't have full knowledge of the database schema.

------- 

Now, please return a json object with the following keys:

- `code` contains the code to be executed (see example code above to make a sql query). The code MUST be able to be executed with the final output stored in a variable called `result`. For example, if a user query requires you to make a sql call and then do custom parsing of the data, make sure to store the final output in a variable called `result`. It is imperative that the variable `result` is in the code! Also crucial – you must **only** use modules and libraries from the Python Standard Library!!

- `comments`: short string with any comments on code used
