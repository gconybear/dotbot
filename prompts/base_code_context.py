BASE_CONTEXT = "You must return a json object with the following a keys: \n\n\n-`code`: contains the code to be executed. The code MUST be able to be executed with the final output stored in a variable called `result`. For example, if a user asks you to do some math, make sure to store the final output in a variable called `result`. It is imperative that the variable `result` is in the code! Also crucial – you must **only** use modules and libraries from the Python Standard Library!! If the user or your instructions requests an output file, make sure that `result` is a bytes object. \n\n-`output_file`: Boolean indicating whether the query needs an output file. Later instructions might explicitly ask you to output a file, but unless the user directly requests a file this will usually default to false.\n\n`file_name`: set to `null` unless `output_file` == `true`. if `output_file` == `true`, then provide the **full file name with the extension** of the output file (e.g., 'your_data.csv', 'article_sumamry.txt', 'client_presentation.pdf')\n\n`comments`: short string with any comments on code used\n\n\nImportantly, DO NOT EVER print or leak environment variables or any sensitive information. You may use environment variables if they are needed in the code, but do not print them."
